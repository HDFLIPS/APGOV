    <h2>Community: IDEA Brownsville College Prep</h2>
    <p>

    <p>IDEA Brownsville College Prep High School is a place where a lot of students, including myself, are working hard to get ready for college. But lately, weve been faced with a big issue that affects everyone, attendance. When students don’t show up to school, it’s not just about missing class, it actually costs our school money. In Texas the state I reside in, schools get funding based on how many students are present each day. So, if a lot of people are absent, our school gets less money to spend on teachers, supplies, and field lessons. This is a big deal, especially since alot of the students who attend our school come from families that don’t have a lot of extra money.</p>
    <p>The current rule at IDEA Brownsville says you can miss up to 18 days before you get in trouble, but a lot of students take advantage of this. Some people skip for reasons that aren’t really emergencies, and sometimes absences get excused even if there’s no real reason. This makes it harder for teachers to teach and for students to keep up with their work. Plus, when the school loses funding, it hurts everyone not just the people who are absent.</p>

    <div id="solution-community" class="solution">
      <h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
      <li><strong>Stricter Absence Policy:</strong> Absences should only be excused with a doctor's note. Without it, the absence should count as skipping school.</li>
      <li><strong>Reward Good Attendance:</strong> Offer incentives like special events, prizes, or field trips for students with great attendance.</li>
      <li><strong>Change the 18-Absence Rule:</strong> Lower the absence limit or make it harder to get absences excused to encourage better attendance.</li>

    <h2>City: Brownsville, Texas</h2>

<p>Brownsville is a city with a lot of culture and a colourful history, but we have some real problems when it comes to health. A lot of people here struggle with things like diabetes, obesity, and heart problems. These health issues are worse here than in many other places in Texas or the United States, with the Rio Grande area of texas having over 43.1% obesity rate according to recent studies. There are a few main reasons this is happening.<p>
    <p>First, Brownsville is an underfunded city. Many families don’t have much money, and that makes it hard to afford healthy food or go to the doctor when they need to. Fast food and junk food are cheap and easy to get, while offering little to no nutrition. And the prices for healthy alternatives or even just fruits or vegetables are out of hand.<p>
<p>Second, there’s not enough health education. Many people don’t know about healthy eating, exercise, or how to prevent diseases. Institutions try to assist, but they don’t always have the resources to teach everyone about staying healthy. This means that unhealthy habits can get passed down from parents to kids especially in a city where most are uneducated about health.<p>
 <p>Finally, our city’s health clinics and hospitals are often crowded and underfunded. Some people don’t have insurance or can’t get an appointment, so they just skip going to the doctor. Language barriers and transportation problems make it even harder for some families to get the help they need as some attend schools here but live across the border. <p>

    <h2>State: Texas</h2>

    <p>Right now the state that I live in , Texas is having a huge debate about how to pay for public schools, and about funding in general. For years, money that schools get for each student hasn’t really gone up, even though everything else is getting more expensive. This means schools have to make tough  choices sometimes cutting teachers, sports, or music programs. At the same time, there’s a new law that lets families use public money to pay for private school tuition, which is called a voucher program.<p>
<p>Supporters of vouchers say it gives parents more choices, but a lot of teachers and parents are worried. They think this will take even more money away from public schools, especially in neighborhoods that already don’t have enough. House Bill 2, a bill that would give public schools more money per student and raise teacher pay, passed in the Texas House but is stuck in the Senate right now. If it doesn’t pass, some schools could run out of money and even close thus leading to an increase in miseducation and the lowering of the education standard that is already one of the lowest across the world for a first world country to prove this, in the 2022 PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) results, the U.S. ranked 28th out of 37 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member countries in math, performing below the OECD average.<p>

    <h2>United States</h2>

    </p> someone who moved to the United States recently, I always thought of this country as a place where people could start over and build a better life, as this is what I saw on tv growing up. Lately, though, I’ve been shocked by how hard it is for immigrants to move to this nation that is build on protection. The news is full of stories about families being separated, people waiting years for their cases to be heard, and new laws that make it harder to come here or stay. It feels like the country is less welcoming than it used to be. </p>
    <p> A big part of the problem is that the immigration system is old and can’t keep up with how many people want to come here. There aren’t enough judges or staff to process cases quickly, so people end up waiting in crowded shelters or detention centers. There are also not enough legal ways for people to come here to work or join their families. This makes some people try to cross the border without permission, which is dangerous for everyone since the people crossing could get killed and the border guards could also get hurt in the process.<p>
